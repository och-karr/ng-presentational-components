Detach the component from change detection using `ChangeDetectionRef`

## Template Components

### Avatar

Add Input called `imageUrl` of type string.
Add Input called `text` of type string.

Bind `imageUrl` to `src` attribute of `img`

Create ViewModel for Card that contains `title:string` and `description:string`

Add Input called `card` of type created ViewModel.

Bind `title` to `h2`

## Rating View

Create a component with a selector `rating-view` and html that contains `<i>` icons.

There are 3 possile icon css classes:

- icon-star-empty
- icon-star-half-empty
- icon-star

Add Input called `max` of type number
Add Input called `value` of type number
Add Output called `clicked` of type number

Build as many icons as range between 1 and `max` number
Show correct icon css class depending on the `value` input

Assume that `value <= max` and `max > 0` and `value` can be a float (0.2,1.5,3.7, etc.) and `max` is always a full number (1,2,3,4,5, etc.)

When I click on any star, then:

- it should select this start
- and all the stars on the left
- and it should emit the value of the star (number from `1` to `max`)

### Read More Panel

Create component with a selector `read-more-panel` and html that contains `section` in which you will have `p` on top, then `button` and finally another `p` at the bottom

Create ViewModel that will be representation of internal state of the template

Add Input called `mainText` of type string
Add Input called `readMoreText` of type string
Add Input called `openLabel` of type string with default value `Read more`
Add Input called `closedLabel` of type string with default value `Read less`

Bind `mainText` to first `p` element
Bind `readMoreText` to bottom `p` element

We have 2 states in the template: Open and Closed state

Closed state is the default state of the component.

In Closed state:

- Hide second `p` element
- Button label should be value of `openLabel` input

In Open state:

- Show second `p` element
- Button label should be value of `closedLabel` input

Note: If at any time I change either `openLabel` or `closedLabel`, then it may affect the button label depending on which state is currently active
